        <p>     Stress, anxiety, depression, banana. These are all words. 3 of these words plague college students across the country. Professor Amadeus Hole at FaKe College has invented this new revolutionary technology to let students relax regardless of their major or their mental fortitude. 
        </br>   "So my revolutionary piece of technology can't really be described. It's much easier if I just show you but it's not quite done yet." Professor Hole said on record. "However, there may be a sneak peak or <a href = "spiral.html">something like that</a> in this article somewhere."
        </br>   Professor Hole showed our journalists his new method. Our journalists didn't really remember what happened but they woke feeling great. Nervous, tired, confused, nauseus. These were all words said by our journalists. But those feelings didn't matter once the method was used. 
After Amadeus showed us his revolutionary new technology, all of our worries disappeared. Stress was gone, drowziness was gone, and confusion was gone. Originally, this article was a lot more negative towards Professor Hole's methods but after he showed me the technology, my mind changed instantly.

Go out there and get relaxed NOW.</p>
